Tips:
* Include a FULL description of the problem or enhancement or idea. Include:
   * What happened (details)?
   * What did you expect to happen?
   * What is different between what happened and what you expected?
   * What versions of the software are you working on?

   * Use a numbered list of steps.
   * DETAILS: Be explicit. More is better, than little, which is better than nothing. Never assume we know what you're talking about (assume we don't know).
* Include screenshots to support the info above, but NEVER replace a good description with a screenshot.
